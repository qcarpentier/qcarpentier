# 👋 Welcome to my GitHub !

I'm Quentin Carpentier, a [**Full Stack Developer**](https://qcarpentier.com) with over 8 years of experience delivering innovative and high-performance software solutions. I’m currently an **IT teacher** at Haute École Condorcet Mons (Belgium), where I teach programming and IT to higher education students. I hold a **CAP** (Certificat d'Aptitudes Pédagogiques), equipping me with the skills to guide and mentor the next generation of developers.

In addition to teaching, I’ve returned to academia, pursuing a **Computer Science degree** at **UMons** via an evening schedule to deepen my technical expertise while continuing my career. When I’m not coding or teaching, I’m pushing my physical limits as an **ultra-trail runner**, frequently competing in 100+ km races.
